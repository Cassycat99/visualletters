And I have 6 Cats
If I could I'd have all the cats
How many cats is too many cats?


There's no such number, number

And I have 6 cats
I wish I had infinity cats
You should adopt a couple of cats
I have 6 cats

This is Lily,
She's my oldest kitty
This is Abby,
She's a fat tabby

This is Jimmy,
He's a grumpy kitty
This is Congress,
He's dumb
And he doesnt do anything

This is Beetle,
He was a dumpster baby
We chopped off his balls
But he's still crazy
This is Ghost,
And she growls
On cue!
She's either a really good 4
Or a really bad 2
